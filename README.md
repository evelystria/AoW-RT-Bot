# AoW-RT-Bot
> A personal bot designed with PyAutoGUI

This is part of my 'study-the-examples' series, of how certain things can be done in python through 3rd-party libraries. Scripts are designed as accord to me, and not for client use. You can however download and edit them to work on your computer.

## Documentation
### Libraries
- PyAutoGUI
### Usage
Since this bot is designed using PyAutoGUI for personal use, the script is not flawless and have many bugs. Technically, if memory hacking were to be used instead it would be much more effective.

Unfortunately the way it is coded is so restrictive thus:
* Supports ONLY
  * Resolution: 1280x720 @ windowed mode
  * Atlac units of the following order:
    * Silver Guardian
    * Heavy Blade Slave
    * Scholar
    * Wrath Chanter
    * Shadow Fish
    * Staff Slave
    * Vajra
    * Lightning Arhat
    * Azure Dragon
    * Great Whale
